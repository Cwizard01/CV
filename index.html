    <blockquote>Just a quick note to reinforce from the front lines that Dartmouth's unique legacy in CS is making a big difference. As a graduate of '91 working in venture capital in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, I see that the Dartmouth training is generating many people who are truly bringing the next generation of technologies into reality. Keep up the great work.  -- Anonymous '91
